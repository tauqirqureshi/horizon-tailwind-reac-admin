Got it 👍 You’re asking as a designer: how to design a “Sub-Organization” table for a School Management System (web view) and what fields to include.

I’ll assume:

Organization = School Group / Trust / Main School

Sub-Organization = Branch, Campus, Department, or Unit

Below is a clean, practical table design that works well for most school systems.

1. Sub_Organization Table (Core)

This table defines each sub-unit under a school.

Essential Fields
Field Name	Type	Why it’s needed
sub_org_id	PK (INT / UUID)	Unique identifier
org_id	FK	Links to main organization (school/trust)
sub_org_name	VARCHAR	Name (e.g., “Science Department”, “Main Campus”)
sub_org_code	VARCHAR	Short code (SCI, CAMP01)
sub_org_type	ENUM	Campus / Department / Branch / Section
description	TEXT	Optional explanation
status	ENUM	Active / Inactive
created_at	DATETIME	Record creation
updated_at	DATETIME	Last update
2. Location & Contact (Very Useful for Web View)
Field Name	Type
address	TEXT
city	VARCHAR
state	VARCHAR
country	VARCHAR
postal_code	VARCHAR
phone	VARCHAR
email	VARCHAR

👉 Helps display branch info directly on dashboards and public pages.

3. Academic / Functional Info
Field Name	Type	Example
head_id	FK (user/staff)	Department Head / Campus Head
academic_year	VARCHAR	2025–2026
grades_offered	VARCHAR / JSON	1–5, 6–10
capacity	INT	Max students
current_strength	INT	Enrolled students
4. Permissions & Control (Important for Web Apps)
Field Name	Type
allow_admissions	BOOLEAN
allow_attendance	BOOLEAN
allow_exams	BOOLEAN
allow_fee_collection	BOOLEAN

👉 Lets admin enable/disable features per sub-organization.

5. Optional (Advanced / Scalable Design)

If you want future-proofing:

metadata (JSON) → store custom configs

logo_url → branch logo

timezone

sort_order → display order in UI

6. Simple Example (Real Life)

Sub_Organization

Name: Main Campus

Type: Campus

Head: Principal

Grades: 1–12

Status: Active

Sub_Organization

Name: Science Department

Type: Department

Head: HOD Science

Grades: 6–12

7. Designer Tip 🧠

If you’re unsure:

Campus = physical

Department = academic

Section = class-level

Use one table + type field instead of many tables → easier UI & maintenance.

If you want, I can:

Draw ER Diagram

Suggest API response format

Design Admin Web UI view

Optimize for multi-school SaaS
